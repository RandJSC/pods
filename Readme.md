**Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields in WordPress.**

## Description

Check out http://podsframework.org/ for our User Guide, Forums, and other resources to help you develop with Pods.

### Content types that evolve with your needs
Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy to use interface that lets you manage custom fields and how your content type will function.

We now give you the power you've never before had with a single plugin because we've reimagined how to manage content types from the ground up.

### Create new content types
With Pods, you can create entirely new content types:

* Custom Post Types - Content types that look and function like Posts and Pages, but in their own separate areas
* Custom Taxonomies - Content types that look and function like Categories and Tags, but in their own separate areas
* Advanced Content Types - These are entirely separate from WordPress and function off their own database tables

### Extend existing content types
Not satisfied? How about the power of being able to extend existing content types? We've got you covered with extending these major WordPress objects:

* Post Types - Create and manage fields for any existing Post Type (Posts, Pages, etc), even those created by plugins or themes
* Taxonomies - Create and manage fields for any existing Taxonomies (Categories, Tags, etc), even those created by plugins or themes
* Media - Create and manage fields for your media uploads, easily add additional information and context to any file you want
* Users - Create and manage fields for your user profiles, this is truly the bees knees!
* Comments - Create and manage fields for your visitor comments, easily add fields to fit the way you use comments as reviews and more

### Use our field types, or make your own
We have a lot of common field types available for you to use, or you can build your own with our extensible field type classes.

Each of these field type have their own set of options, if those aren't enough they are also easily extended:

* Date / Time - Date, Time, or both
* Number - Plain Number or Currency
* Text - Plain Text, Website, Phone, E-mail, or Password
* Paragraph Text - Plain Paragraph, WYSIWYG (TinyMCE or CLEditor, or add your own), or Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* Color Picker - Choose colors, because colors are great
* Yes / No - You can't really go wrong with a checkbox, but we've added a few charms to make it stand out
* File / Image / Video - Upload new media or select from existing ones with our Media Library integration, or use a simple uploader, your choice
* Relationships - Relate any item, to any item of any WP object type or another Pod

### Easily display your content
There are several ways to get Pods data to show up throughout your site, but with any WP object type you create or extend with Pods, you can use all of the functions and methods you're already used to -- out of the box!

We'll add some more documentation here about our fully revamped Theming API, stay tuned! Our United Theming API lets you theme your content types across every type of Pod, regardless if it's a post type or taxonomy, or.. you get the picture.

### Customized Management Panels
Utilize Pods UI (included in Pods 1.10+) to build your own Custom Management panels for your Pods.

### Optional Components to do even more
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* Roles and Capabilities - Create or edit Roles for your site, and customize their corresponding capabilities
* Pages - Create custom pages that function off of your site's path, with wildcard support, and choose the Page Template to use
* Templates - Use our template engine to create templates that can be handed off to clients for carefree management
* Helpers - Customize how Pods works right from the admin area with simple to advanced reusable code snippets
