        This plugin is an <strong>beta</strong> version, it is not meant for use on production/live sites and is not 100% complete with functionality yet.
        This plugin has been released for developers and users so they can help test, review the new UI, and provide feedback regarding Pods 2.0 and let us know of any bugs they come across.
